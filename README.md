# AI-Driven-Red-Wine-Quality-Predictor
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project focused on predicting the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier, this AI model assesses various physicochemical features to predict wine quality levels accurately.

Project Components:

Data Preprocessing: Standardization of features to ensure consistent data scale across all input variables.
Visualization: Includes plots for the distribution of wine quality and a heatmap of feature correlations to provide insights into the data.
Model Training: Implementation of a Random Forest Classifier, a robust model capable of handling non-linear data.
Polynomial Feature Enhancement: Exploration of polynomial features to improve model predictions by capturing interactions between features.
Evaluation: Detailed classification reports and accuracy assessments to evaluate the model's performance.
Purpose:
The goal of this project is to showcase how machine learning can be applied in the food and beverage industry, particularly in quality assessment, providing a tool that could potentially aid manufacturers and enthusiasts in understanding and improving wine quality.

Usage:
Instructions for setting up, running the model, and interpreting the outputs are provided, making it accessible for further development and educational purposes.
